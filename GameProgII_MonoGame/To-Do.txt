Fix the sprites bounding box. (i scaled the sprite in Draw to see him better, now the bounding box which is based off the texture is
too small for the size of the sprite that is drawn)
	- find new sprite
	- recalculate the size of the bounding box

add a score system
	- track the mid point of each pipe
	- if player passes the mid point => increment score
